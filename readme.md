Microsite CSS
=============

A simple example website showing how to use the JNCC Website CSS to make a microsite with the same look and feel.

Open it up using a `file:///` URL like `file:///home/pete/work/microsite-css/index.html`. 

The `frontend-orignal` folder is taken directly, for reference, from the `frontend` folder in the JNCC Website source code, as created by the website contractor Carbon Six Digital, on 11 April 2019.

The `frontend` folder here contains just those files we determined were needed to make a microsite. You could copy additional files from the original source if necessary.

> A production build of a microsite could reference all the files in `frontend` in the parent JNCC website (like `../frontend` or whatever) to save the user needing to download these (fairly large) files more than once.

To make a new microsite, copy the `frontend` folder from here into your project and use `index.html` as a reference for building the markup.
